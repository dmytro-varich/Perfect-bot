[Perfect Bot](https://t.me/your_perfect_bot) is your personal assistant for tracking nutrition and achieving healthy lifestyle goals in [Telegram](https://web.telegram.org/). It is designed for those who want to easily manage their diet, monitor their intake of calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, and achieve their fitness goals.

## Futures

- **🧾 Create a Personal Profile**

    On the first launch, the bot prompts the user to fill out a short profile: gender, age, height, weight, physical activity level, and goal (lose weight, maintain, or gain mass). Based on this information, it calculates a personalized daily intake of calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.

    </p>


- 🍱 **User-Defined Product Menu**

    Users can create a list of their own food items by specifying the calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates per 100 grams. These items can then be quickly added to the daily log — just enter the consumed amount, and the bot will automatically calculate the daily and weekly nutrition stats.

- 👤 **Profile and Daily Stats**

    The bot displays the user's profile along with the current nutrition progress for the day.

- ⏱ **Quick Food Entry**

    Users can instantly log a meal by entering the calories, proteins, fats, and carbs per 100g and the amount consumed — without needing to add the product to the menu first.

    The interface is available in both English and Ukrainian.

| **Meal Notifications**        | Add a feature that allows users to set specific times for meal reminders. The bot would send a notification at those times to help users stay on track with their nutrition plan.                                  |
| **AI-based Meal Suggestions** | Implement a system using AI or rule-based logic to suggest food items that can help the user reach their daily macronutrient goals. Based on the current intake, the bot would recommend what and how much to eat. |
