## Futures

- **üßæ Create a Personal Profile**

    On the first launch, the bot prompts the user to fill out a short profile: gender, age, height, weight, physical activity level, and goal (lose weight, maintain, or gain mass). Based on this information, it calculates a personalized daily intake of calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.

    </p>


- üç± **User-Defined Product Menu**

    Users can create a list of their own food items by specifying the calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates per 100 grams. These items can then be quickly added to the daily log ‚Äî just enter the consumed amount, and the bot will automatically calculate the daily and weekly nutrition stats.

| **Meal Notifications**        | Add a feature that allows users to set specific times for meal reminders. The bot would send a notification at those times to help users stay on track with their nutrition plan.                                  |
| **AI-based Meal Suggestions** | Implement a system using AI or rule-based logic to suggest food items that can help the user reach their daily macronutrient goals. Based on the current intake, the bot would recommend what and how much to eat. |
